**Giftable Badges and Achievements:

Add a badge or achievement system where premium users can unlock and send “achievements” to others based on chat frequency, engagement level, or challenges.
This could include badges like “Night Owl” for late-night chats, or “Best Friend,” which users could “gift” to friends, adding an element of fun and gamification.**


Another option is allowing premium users to apply disintegrate on specific messages within a chat rather than the entire conversation.
